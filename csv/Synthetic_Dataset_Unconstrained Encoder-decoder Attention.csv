Question,Answer
What is the primary issue that the proposed method addresses in the context of text-to-speech (TTS) models?,"The primary issue that the proposed method addresses in the context of text-to-speech (TTS) models is the removal of encoder-decoder attention mechanisms to improve stability, while also introducing a pseudo non-causal attention mechanism to replace causal self-attention layers."
"The encoder-decoder attention mechanism is a crucial factor for instability, but removing it will also discard its advantages.","The encoder-decoder attention mechanism provides a holistic view of the input sequence for the decoder and composes frame-level context vectors according to decoder inputs. Removing it will discard its advantages but also prevents instability that can arise from certain cases, such as abnormal speech."
How does the proposed pseudo non-causal attention (PNCA) replace the causal self-attention layers in the decoder?,"The proposed pseudo non-causal attention (PNCA) replaces the causal self-attention layers in the decoder by using a combination of mel frames and encoder hidden states. The left part of PNCA is similar to causal self-attention, which takes encoder hidden states fused with padded mel spectrum frames as input, while the right part consumes only the encoder hidden states."
"PNCA takes the encoder hidden states fused with padded mel spectrum frames by a linear projection as input, and consumes only the encoder hidden states.",The encoder hidden states fused with padded mel spectrum frames by a linear projection is used as input for PNCA's causal self-attention.
What is the purpose of using duration predictor in the TTS model?,The purpose of using a duration predictor in the TTS model is to generate correct content by forcing the decoder to copy encoder hidden states to their corresponding frames based on predicted logarithmic duration.
To predict the logarithmic duration of each encoder hidden state and generate ground truth duration for the model training.,"To predict the logarithmic duration of each encoder hidden state and generate ground truth duration for model training, a duration predictor structure is used with two convolutional layers, normalization, dropout, and a linear projection. Mean squared error is employed as the loss function. Speech recognition tools are used to make forced alignment between audio and phoneme sequence, then predicted duration is used to copy and expand phoneme-level features to frame-level features accordingly."
How does the phoneme-level features are copied and expanded to frame-level features according to the predicted duration?,"The phoneme-level features are copied and expanded to frame-level features according to the predicted duration by first computing the logarithmic duration of each encoder hidden state using a duration predictor consisting of two convolutional layers and a linear projection. Then, the predicted duration is used to tile the encoded states into time steps. The tiled encoded states are concatenated with the mel spectrum frames processed by Decoder Pre-net, and then through a linear projection. This results in a frame-level context vector that can be used for pseudo non-causal attention."
The phoneme-level features are copied and expanded to frame-level features by using the predicted duration.,The predicted duration is used to copy and expand phoneme-level features to frame-level features.
What is the main advantage of PNCA in comparison to causal self-attention layers?,"The main advantage of PNCA over causal self-attention layers is that it provides a holistic view of the input sequence for the decoder while also composing frame-level context vectors according to decoder inputs, making the decoding procedure robust."
